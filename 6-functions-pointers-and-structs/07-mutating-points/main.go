/*
Create three functions - incPtr, incNoPtr and incNewPtr which all take in a point and increment its values by 1. Hereâ€™s the catch:
incPtr should take in a pointer to a point & modify its contents
incNoPtr should take a point without a pointer & modify its contents
incNewPtr should take in a pointer and assign it a new Point with the incremented values
Print the values of the three points after being incremented. Anything unusual?
