package main

/*
Declare two variables a and b with values 14 and 32. Swap their values such that a contains 32 and b contains 14.

Example:
Before swapping:
a = 14
b = 32

After swapping
a = 32
b = 14


Print the resulting numbers on the terminal.
Extra Challenge: Find a way to do this without an extra variable
