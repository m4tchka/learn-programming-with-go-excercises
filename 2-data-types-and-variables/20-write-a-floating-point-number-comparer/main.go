/*
Write a program which compares two float numbers with a given acceptable delta of 0.00005.

In example, the numbers 3.100005 and 3.100003 are considered equal as their difference is less than the given delta.

Hint: for this task, youâ€™ll need to learn about if-else statements.

Examples:
3.100005 is equal to 3.100003
1.12003 is not equal to 1.12009
*/
